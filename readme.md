# Another chrome tab manager extension 

Currently, it can only list the existing chrome tabs grouped by window and tab groups.
To test it, clone the extension to local and do the following:

* Load the Extension:
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/. Enable "Developer mode" and click on "Load unpacked". Select the directory where your extension files are located.

* Test the Extension:
Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to see your popup. You can click the "Close All Tabs" button to test the functionality.

TODO:
- [ ] make the tab item clickable: currently, this function is coded but it does not work
- [ ] make the tab group and window name more readable
- [ ] label duplicated tabs
- [ ] move tabs around within the tool
- [ ] a global short-cut key
- [ ] beatify the popup window

- [ ] search for tabs (P2 as this is already embedded in chrome)

The extension does not collect any data but please use it with cautious.
